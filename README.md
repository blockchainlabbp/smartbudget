# SmartBudget - the smart budget manager dapp

## Setting up the development environment

This dapp is based on the Truffle `webpack` box. To avoid storing all Javascript packages along with the source code, the `node_modules` folder has been deleted.
This means that after pulling this git repo, you first need to do

`npm install`

from the directory where you pulled the repo. Afterwards, all Truffle commands should work.
